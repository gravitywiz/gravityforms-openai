## 1.0-beta-1

	- Added a Gravity Flow Step Type for OpenAI. Credit: @Idealien
	- Added new `nl2br` modifier that can be used on merge tags to convert newlines into `<br />`'s. This is useful when outputting plain-text responses into HTML using Live Merge Tags. Example: `@{:1:openai_feed_5,nl2br}`.
	- Fixed issue where feed conditional logic and feed status (active/inactive) were not checked during validation for the Moderations endpoint.
	- Fixed issue where feed status was not taken into account during merge tag replacement so inactive feeds would still have their merge tags replaced.
	- Added new Chat Completions endpoint.
	- Added auto-updater powered by GitHub Releases.
	- Added new capabilities to grant/deny access to OpenAI settings and to uninstall it.

## 1.0-alpha-1.8

	- Fixed an issue where GP Populate Anything values would not get populated when Gravity Forms OpenAI was enabled.
	- Fixed an issue where OpenAI responses could be displayed in the Form Editor.

## 1.0-alpha-1.7

	- Removed `Perk: True` from the plugin header to address potential PHP errors.

## 1.0-alpha-1.6

	- Added new `raw` modifier that can be used in the feed merge tags. This allows for fetching specific properties from the OpenAI response. Example usage: `{:1:openai_feed_2,raw[usage/total_tokens]}`

## 1.0-alpha-1.5

	- Updated feed merge tags to evaluate feed conditional logic (if configured) before returning a result. If the conditional logic does not evaluate as truthy, an empty string is returned.
	- Updated secret key setting to be a masked input.

## 1.0-alpha-1.4

	- Added new `gf_openai_request_body` PHP filter for customizing requests that go to OpenAI.
	- Added support for using custom/fine-tuned models when using the Completions endpoint.

## 1.0-alpha-1.3

	- Added kses/strip_all_tags (depending on if field is using rich text editor) to `maybe_save_result_to_field()`.
	- Fixed regression where field map values weren't correctly saving (they would work in notifications/confirmation, however).
	- Added conditional logic for feeds.

## 1.0-alpha-1.2

	- Fixed issue where results in mapped fields would not show in notifications.
